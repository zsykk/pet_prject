# Pet Project – Daily Step Analysis with My Pet

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for my personal pet project,
where I analyze my own daily step counts over time. 
`health_xml_to_csv.py` is the code I used to parse raw data in .xml and generate .csv dataset, due to that part of the raw dataset include private data, I did not include the original source document.

## Data
- Data was collected personally using a step-tracking device.
- No third-party or external datasets were used.

## Structure
- /data: raw and processed data
- /notebooks: analysis notebooks

## Reproducibility
